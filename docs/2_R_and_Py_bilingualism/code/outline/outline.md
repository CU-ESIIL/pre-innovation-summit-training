## II. Language Basics (10 minutes)

### A. R

#### 1. RStudio and R environment:

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that
provides a user-friendly interface and a comprehensive set of tools for
coding, debugging, and visualization. The R environment is an
interactive programming platform that allows you to write and execute R
code, manage packages, and explore data structures. RStudio is a popular
choice among R users, as it simplifies many tasks and improves overall
workflow.

R code:

``` r
# Example of R code
     x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     y <- x * 2
     print(y)
```

    [1]  2  4  6  8 10

#### 2. R syntax:

     R syntax is characterized by its use of assignment operators (e.g., `<-`), functions, and control structures (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`). R is case-sensitive, and comments are denoted by the pound sign (`#`). One notable feature of R syntax is its preference for the use of vectors and vectorized operations, which can lead to concise and efficient code.

R code:

``` r
# Example of R syntax
     x <- seq(1, 10)
     y <- x^2
     if (mean(y) > 20) {
       print("Mean is greater than 20")
     }
```

    [1] "Mean is greater than 20"

### B. Python

#### 1. Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, IDEs):

Python can be run in various environments, such as Jupyter Notebook, a
browser-based interactive computing platform that allows you to write,
run, and share code, as well as create rich-text documents with embedded
code, equations, and visualizations. Other popular Python IDEs include
Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Spyder, which offer syntax
highlighting, code completion, and debugging features.

R code:

``` r
 # Example of R code
     x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     y <- x * 2
     print(y)
```

    [1]  2  4  6  8 10

     }
```

    [1] "Mean is greater than 20"

#### 2. Python syntax:

     Python syntax is designed to be readable and concise, using indentation to denote code blocks instead of curly braces or keywords. Python is case-sensitive, and comments are denoted by the hash sign (`#`). Like R, Python supports vectorized operations, especially when using libraries like NumPy or pandas.

Python code:

``` python
# Example of Python code
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [i * 2 for i in x]
print(y)
```

    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

y = [i**2 for i in x]
if sum(y) / len(y) > 20:
  print("Mean is greater than 20")
```

    Mean is greater than 20

\##III. Data Structures (10 minutes) \### A. R \#### 1. Vectors: Vectors
are one-dimensional arrays that can store elements of the same data type
(e.g., numeric, character, logical). They are the most basic data
structure in R and are used extensively in R programming. Vectors can be
created using the c() function.

R code:

``` r
# Example of creating a numeric vector in R
num_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

#### 2. Matrices:

     Matrices are two-dimensional arrays that can store elements of the same data type. They are useful for performing linear algebra operations and can be created using the `matrix()` function.

R code:

``` r
# Example of creating a matrix in R
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
```

#### 3. Lists:

     Lists are ordered collections that can store elements of different data types, including other lists. They are similar to Python's lists but can contain heterogeneous data. Lists can be created using the `list()` function.

R code:

``` r
# Example of creating a list in R
my_list <- list("apple", 42, c(1, 2, 3), TRUE)
```

#### 4. Data frames:

     Data frames are tabular data structures that can store elements of different data types in columns. They are similar to Python's pandas DataFrame and can be created using the `data.frame()` function.

R code:

``` r
# Example of creating a data frame in R
df <- data.frame(name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"),
        age = c(25, 30, 35), height = c(162, 175, 168))
```

### B. Python

#### 1. Lists:

Lists are ordered, mutable collections that can store elements of
different data types. They are similar to R’s lists and can be created
using square brackets \[\].

Python code:

``` python
# Example of creating a list in Python
my_list = ["apple", 42, [1, 2, 3], True]
```

#### 2. Tuples:

     Tuples are ordered, immutable collections that can store elements of different data types. They are similar to Python's lists but cannot be modified after creation. Tuples can be created using parentheses `()`.

Python code:

``` python
# Example of creating a tuple in Python
my_tuple = ("apple", 42, (1, 2, 3), True)
```

#### 3. Sets:

     Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They can store elements of different data types but do not maintain their order. Sets can be created using the `set()` function or curly braces `{}`.

Python code:

``` python
# Example of creating a set in Python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### 4. Dictionaries:

     Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are similar to R's named lists and can store elements of different data types. Dictionaries can be created using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons 

Python code:

``` python
# Example of creating a dictionary in Python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "height": 162}
```

#### 5. pandas DataFrame:

pandas DataFrames are two-dimensional, mutable, and heterogeneous
tabular data structures with labeled axes (rows and columns). They are
similar to R’s data frames and are widely used for data manipulation and
analysis in Python. pandas DataFrames can be created by importing data
from various sources like CSV files, SQL databases, or even from Python
dictionaries or lists.

Python code:

``` python
# Example of creating a pandas DataFrame in Python
import pandas as pd

data = {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol'],
        'age': [25, 30, 35],
        'height': [162, 175, 168]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

## IV. Data Manipulation (15 minutes)

### A. R

#### 1. Base R functions:

Base R functions provide essential tools for data manipulation, such as
subsetting, reshaping, and sorting data. These functions allow you to
perform various data manipulation tasks, including filtering rows or
columns, merging and joining data frames, and aggregating data. Some
commonly used base R functions for data manipulation include subset(),
merge(), aggregate(), and order().

R code:

``` r
# Example of filtering rows using base R functions
df <- data.frame(name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol",        "David"),age = c(25, 30, 35, 28), height = c(162, 175,   168, 172))

# Filter rows where age is greater than 27
filtered_df <- df[df$age > 27, ]
```

#### 2. dplyr and the tidyverse:

     dplyr is a popular R package for data manipulation that is part of the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed for data science. dplyr provides a set of intuitive and easy-to-read functions for data manipulation, such as `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `summarise()`, and `group_by()`. dplyr functions can be chained together using the pipe operator (`%>%`) to create a more readable and efficient workflow.

R code:

``` r
# Example of filtering rows using dplyr
library(dplyr)
```


    Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

        filter, lag

    The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

        intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
df <- data.frame(name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol",        "David"),age = c(25, 30, 35, 28),height = c(162, 175,   168, 172))

# Filter rows where age is greater than 27
filtered_df <- df %>% filter(age > 27)
head(filtered_df)
```

       name age height
    1   Bob  30    175
    2 Carol  35    168
    3 David  28    172

### B. Python

#### 1. Built-in functions:

Python has built-in functions that allow for basic data manipulation,
such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating data. However, these
functions are less flexible and less efficient when compared to
specialized libraries like pandas. Some commonly used built-in functions
for data manipulation include filter(), map(), and sorted().

Python code:

     ```python
     # Example of filtering a list using a built-in function
     data = [{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "height": 162},
             {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "height": 175},
             {"name": "Carol", "age": 35, "height": 168},
             {"name": "David", "age": 28, "height": 172}]

     # Filter items where age is greater than 27
     filtered_data = list(filter(lambda x: x["age"] > 27, data))
     ```

#### 2. pandas library:

     The pandas library is a powerful and flexible data manipulation tool in Python. It provides various functions for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data in a DataFrame format, making it easy to work with structured data. Some common pandas functions for data manipulation include `loc[]`, `iloc[]`, `query()`, `merge()`, `groupby()`, and `agg()`.

Python code:

``` python
# Example of filtering rows using pandas
import pandas as pd

data = {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'David'],
             'age': [25, 30, 35, 28],
             'height': [162, 175, 168, 172]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Filter rows where age is greater than 27
filtered_df = df[df['age'] > 27]
```

     ```python
     # Example of filtering rows using pandas
     import pandas as pd

     data = {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'David'],
             'age': [25, 30, 35, 28],
             'height': [162, 175, 168, 172]}

     df = pd.DataFrame(data)

     # Filter rows where age is greater than 27
     filtered_df = df[df['age'] > 27]
     ```

## V. Data Visualization (10 minutes)

### A. R

#### 1. Base R plotting:

Base R provides built-in plotting functions that enable users to create
simple visualizations directly from data structures like vectors and
data frames. These functions include plot(), hist(), boxplot(), and
barplot(). While base R plotting can create a wide range of
visualizations, the syntax and customization options may be less
intuitive compared to more specialized libraries like ggplot2.

R code:

``` r
# Example of a scatter plot using base R plotting
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))

plot(df$x, df$y, main = "Scatter Plot", xlab = "X-axis", ylab = "Y-axis", col = "blue")
```

![](outline_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)

#### 2. ggplot2:

     ggplot2 is a popular R package for data visualization and is part of the tidyverse. It implements the "Grammar of Graphics" concept, which allows users to create complex and customizable visualizations using a consistent and intuitive syntax. With ggplot2, users can create a wide range of visualizations, including scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more, using functions like `ggplot()`, `geom_point()`, `geom_bar()`, and `geom_histogram()`.

R code:

``` r
# Example of a scatter plot using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_point(color = "blue") +
    ggtitle("Scatter Plot") +
    xlab("X-axis") +
    ylab("Y-axis")
```

![](outline_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)

B. Python \#### 1. matplotlib: matplotlib is a widely-used data
visualization library in Python that provides a comprehensive set of
tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It
is inspired by MATLAB’s plotting system and offers a simple and flexible
interface for creating a wide range of visualizations, such as line
plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms. Some commonly used
matplotlib functions include plot(), scatter(), bar(), and hist().

Python code:

``` python
# Example of a scatter plot using matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [i for i in range(50)]
y = [i**2 for i in x]

plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue')
plt.title('Scatter Plot')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.show()
```
