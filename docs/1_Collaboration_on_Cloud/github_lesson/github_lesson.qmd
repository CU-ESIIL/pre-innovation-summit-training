## I. Introduction (2 minutes)
### A. Brief overview of GitHub:
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration features using Git, a distributed version control system. It enables developers to work together on projects, track changes to code, and efficiently manage different versions of the project. GitHub is widely used in the software development industry and is an essential tool for collaborative projects and maintaining code quality.

### B. Introduce GitHub Desktop and JupyterHub GitHub widget:
GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that simplifies working with Git and GitHub by providing a more visual and intuitive way to manage repositories, branches, commits, and other Git features. JupyterHub GitHub widget, on the other hand, is a built-in widget that integrates Git and GitHub functionality directly into Jupyter notebooks, allowing users to perform version control and collaboration tasks within the Jupyter environment. Both tools help streamline the process of working with GitHub and make it more accessible to users with varying levels of experience with Git and version control.


## II. GitHub Basics (4 minutes)

### A. Repository: 
A repository, often abbreviated as "repo," is the fundamental building block of GitHub. It is a storage space for your project files, including the code, documentation, and other related resources. Each repository also contains the complete history of all changes made to the project files, which is crucial for effective version control. Repositories can be public, allowing anyone to access and contribute, or private, restricting access to specific collaborators.

### B. Fork and Clone:
Forking and cloning are two essential operations for working with repositories on GitHub. Forking creates a personal copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account, enabling you to make changes to the project without affecting the original repo. Cloning, on the other hand, is the process of downloading a remote repository to your local machine for offline development. In GitHub Desktop, you can clone a repository by selecting "Clone a repository from the Internet" and entering the repository URL. In JupyterHub GitHub widget, you can clone a repository by entering the repo URL in the "Clone Repository" section of the widget.

### C. Branches:
Branches are a critical aspect of Git version control, as they allow you to create multiple parallel versions of your project within a single repository. This is particularly useful when working on new features or bug fixes, as it prevents changes from interfering with the main (or "master") branch until they are ready to be merged. Creating a new branch in GitHub Desktop can be done by clicking the "Current Branch" dropdown and selecting "New Branch." In JupyterHub GitHub widget, you can create a new branch by clicking the "New Branch" button in the "Branches" section of the widget.
