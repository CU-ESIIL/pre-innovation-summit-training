# Get ready to innovate: pre-innovation-summit-training
Welcome to the Technical Training Series for the upcoming Innovation Summit! This voluntary 3-class series has been designed to equip attendees with the technical skills and knowledge needed to fully participate in the Summit. Our curriculum includes instruction on GitHub, CyVerse, R, and Python, as well as an introduction to open data and reproducible workflows.

The first class, Collaborating with Others in the Cloud, will introduce attendees to the basics of cloud computing and how to collaborate on projects using GitHub. We will cover the essential features of GitHub, such as repositories, issues, pull requests, and more. Attendees will also learn about version control, a critical component of software development, and how to use it effectively.

The second class, R and Python Bilingualism, will teach attendees about the similarities and differences between these two powerful programming languages. We will discuss the unique features of R and Python and when to use one over the other. Attendees will learn how to switch back and forth between R and Python code and how to use objects from both languages in each.

The third and final class, Open and Reproducible Science, will focus on the importance of transparency and reproducibility in scientific research. Attendees will learn how to create and manage research data and code using CyVerse, a powerful data management platform. We will also cover the principles of open science and how to make research more accessible and impactful.

We are excited to offer this training series as a resource to help attendees get the most out of the Innovation Summit. We hope that you find this series valuable and look forward to working with you in the coming weeks!
